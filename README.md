# It's friday my dudes

## TODO

- read: <https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/>
- structs implementing traits should be borrowable? -> <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36465009/implementing-borrowtrait-for-a-type-that-implements-trait>
- server implementation as other transport layer:
  - mocking interfaces/traits?
  - crud api with repository to check how to properly structure code
  - async calls
