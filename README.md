## TODO

- structs implementing traits should be borrowable? -> <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36465009/implementing-borrowtrait-for-a-type-that-implements-trait>
- server implementation as other transport layer:
  - move to seperate crate for http?
  - implement the rest API
  - also use some preexisting web framework
